## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Responsive design
- Clamp function of CSS
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flex

### What I learned

The important of built a good structure HTML and have a good compression of CSS functions like a `clamp`.

### Continued development

I need to use `clamp` more often, because I want to learn more about it, especially when combined with `font-size`, as well as improving HTML and CSS structures.

### Useful resources

- [Clamp calculator](https://royalfig.github.io/fluid-typography-calculator/) - This helped me to use the `clamp` function on the font size to adjust it to different sizes within the card.
